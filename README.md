# DEVIN AI

## Overview and Origin

An AI model known as Devin is currently being developed by Cognition labs as an autonomous software engineer which is designed to work either by itself, or in collaboration with humam developers.
Cognition, which was founded by Steven Hao and Walden Yan in November 2024, intends to allow more individuals to turn their ideas into reality by "solving reasoning" and removing the nuances of syntax from the development of code.
The company is well-funded, including a <span style="color:green;font-weight:700;font-size:20px">$21 million
</span>  Series A led by Founders Fund<sup>[1]</sup>.

## Business Activities
By taking the complexities and nuances of syntax out of code development, this allows entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into reality more quickly, companies to run leaner, and software developers to focus on more complex and engaging puzzles<sup>[1][2]</sup>.
Currently, the main use cases for Devin are website creation, app development, and software testing <sup>[3]</sup>.
Considering that future versions of this product could potentially be used by individuals without any real programming experience, this product is potentially valuable to every organization, from single-member LLC's to massive companies, assuming the price is within their means.
By running leaner, it's likely that most organizations will be able to save money utilizing DEVIN, in lieu of multiple software developers.
Regarding Devin, Cognition states the following:
>We evaluated Devin on SWE-bench, a challenging benchmark that asks agents to resolve real-world GitHub issues found in open source projects like Django and scikit-learn.
Devin correctly resolves 13.86% of the issues end-to-end, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art of 1.96%. Even when given the exact files to edit, the best previous models can only resolve 4.80% of issues.

*It's clear that, at this point, this product far surpasses competitors in the marketplace, and it is truly one-of-a-kind.
*Devin is able to work with a variety of languages including, Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Swift, Rust, Go, PHP, SQL <sup>[4]</sup>, and is also equipped with developer tools such as shell, a code editor, and browser within a compute sandboxed environment, giving it everything it needs to complete its tasks <sup>[2]</sup>.

## Landscape
DEVIN is a part of a growing trend in the tech space to automate code development, but 
While it is absolutely groundbreaking and state-of-the-art, it stands on the shoulders of other models such as Claude, ChatGPT, and Code Llama <sup>[1]</sup>.
These other models have been developed by the organizations Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta, respectively.

## Results
The product is still in its test phase, however, it is already disrupting the industry. Companies are able to reach out for early access and join the waitlist to hire Devin for engineering work.
Devin far exceeds the problem-solving metrics of all other available AI code development tools on the market, providing roughly 7 times the efficacy of its next-highest competitor, Claude 2 <sup>[1]</sup> 

## Recommendations
Devin is still nascent, and still requires further development before it's production-ready. At this time, there are no true competitors it has to fend off, or that it can take significant insight from.
That being said, I believe the next steps for the tool is if it can perform QA for the code it has written itself. 
A major benefit or addition would be the ability to set up unit tests and a verification/validation pipeline on Jenkins or something similar for any code that is developed.
This seems like that natural next step and would remove the burden from the QA team and any developers who have not worked on the code itself.
Going back through and trying to understand Devin's code sufficiently to write appropriate unit tests and come up with V&V cases would significantly reduce efficiency of the company and team.
Additionally, I've found that some QA testers don't have significant SWE experience and can require a lot of direction. 
It's possible that tests could be performed more effictively by a model like Devin.
